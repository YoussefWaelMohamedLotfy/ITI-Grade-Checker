# ITI Grade Checker

A scraper that gets your grades for you. No more browsers needed.

## The idea behind this project

This project is a simple Console App that uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/) to automate the process for you. Playwright does the scrapping while you only wait for your grades to show for you.
